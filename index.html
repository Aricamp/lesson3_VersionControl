            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is a way of allowing members of a project to access, edit, and share project files in a way that minimizes the problems that come with file sharing. One of these problems that a version control system (VCS) solves is files being overwritten. Suppose someone on your team made a change to a file that you don’t agree with. If your team member overwrote the original file in the process, there isn’t much that can be done to fix it outside of manually undoing all of the work that team member just did. With a VCS, members of the team check out a copy of the file that they may work on, but the original committed file remains untouched.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a version control system, primarily used for managing source code, but capable of managing any type of files. Git is entirely free and open source, which is largely why it is so widely distributed. It is also quite popular due to the fact that its focus is to be as extremely fast, secure, and flexible. Git was originally developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to be used in the development of the Linux kernel after free use of BitKeeper was withdrawn. Today, sites like GitHub allow for easy access to git, allowing for file sharing and collaboration unlike anything before it.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Repositories</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control Systems involve the use of remote and local repositories. The remote repository is located on some remote server that is running the VCS. This repository is where all of the “committed” files are stored. This repository is accessible to every team member with access to the VCS. The local repository is located on the local computer of the user accessing the VCS. The local repository is where a copy of the file the user wishes to work on is stored. When the user requests the file from the remote repository, a copy is moved into the local repository on the user’s machine.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In order to use Git, one must know the language. This language consists mainly of a few commands. The most basic commands include “init”, “add”, “commit”, “log”, “status”, “remote”, “pull”, and “push”. All of these commands must have “git” in front of all of them. The first command one will generally use is the “pull” command. This is a combination of the “fetch” command, which moves files from the remote to the local repository, and the “merge” command, which moves files from the local repository to the local project. After a file is done being worked on it can be moved to the index with “add”, then further moved to the local repository with “commit”. After all files have been moved to the local repository, they can be sent back to the remote repository with “push”.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub is the primary version control system that we will be using in this course. GitHub was founded in 2008 as a means of hosting VCSs in a web-based format. Since it is based entirely on the web it is extremely beneficial to this class. So long as we have connection to the internet, we have access to the files stored on it. GitHub allows us, through the use of SSH keys, to transfer our source code files on Cloud9, acting as our local repositories, to a remote repository on the GitHub servers. All within the bash terminal on Cloud9 and entirely free.</p>
